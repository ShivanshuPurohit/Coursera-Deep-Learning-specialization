# Coursera-Deep-Learning-specialization

A repository of my submissions for the 5 course specialization on Deep Learning by deeplearning.ai. The specialization covers everything from basic neural networks to specialized networks such as CNNs and RNNs, along with best practices for creating your own deep learninng projects.

The specialization includes 5 courses, namely

* Neural Networks and Deep Learning
* Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization
* Structuring Machine Learning Projects
* Convolutional Neural Networks
* Sequence Models
